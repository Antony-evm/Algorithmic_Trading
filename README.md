# Algorithmic_Trading

In this thread, I will explore how to create an algorithmic trading strategy. The idea is to create a strategy using indicators and make a profitable bot in the end.
Thus we need to:
1) Download data for different tickers
2) Create the indicators
3) Create a way to define a strategy
4) Be able to backtest with said strategy
5) Repeat 2-4 until we find a profitable strategy
6) Explore how to create a bot out of that

It will be a journey :)
