## What is Algorithmic Trading?

Algorithmic trading, also known as automated trading or algo trading, is the use of computer algorithms to execute trades in financial markets. Instead of relying on human decision-making, algorithmic trading uses mathematical models and statistical analysis to make trading decisions and execute orders. These algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, including market trends, news, and historical price data, to make informed trading decisions in real-time.

Algorithmic trading is becoming increasingly popular in financial markets due to its speed, efficiency, and accuracy. With algorithmic trading, traders can execute trades faster than humanly possible, which can be crucial in fast-moving markets. It also removes the emotional biases that can affect human traders, leading to more rational and data-driven decisions. Additionally, algorithmic trading can handle complex trading strategies, such as arbitrage and market making, with ease, making it a valuable tool for institutional investors and hedge funds.

Moreover, algorithmic trading is essential in ensuring market liquidity and efficiency. By providing liquidity, algorithmic trading can help reduce market volatility and spreads, making it easier for buyers and sellers to transact. It also helps increase market efficiency by quickly processing a vast amount of information and reacting to market events in real-time. Ultimately, algorithmic trading has become a critical component of modern financial markets, providing traders with an edge in a highly competitive industry while improving the overall efficiency and liquidity of markets.

## What are the crucial parts of a trading algorithm?

A trading algorithm typically consists of several crucial parts, including:

<ol><li>Data Collection: The first step in building a trading algorithm is to collect relevant data. This may include market data, news, economic indicators, and other information that could impact the markets. Data is typically collected in real-time, and historical data may also be used to test and improve the algorithm.</li>

<li>Strategy Formulation: The trading strategy is the heart of any trading algorithm. This is where the trader specifies the rules and conditions under which the algorithm will execute trades. The strategy may be based on technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or a combination of both. The trader may also specify risk management rules, such as stop-loss orders, to limit potential losses.</li>

<li>Algorithm Design: Once the strategy is formulated, the trader must design the algorithm to execute the strategy. This may involve programming the algorithm in a specific programming language or using a platform that allows for drag-and-drop coding.</li>

<li>Backtesting: Before deploying the algorithm in live markets, it's important to test its effectiveness using historical data. Backtesting involves running the algorithm on historical data to see how it would have performed in the past. This allows the trader to refine the strategy and algorithm before deploying it in live markets.</li>

<li>Deployment: Once the algorithm is tested and refined, it can be deployed in live markets. This may involve connecting the algorithm to a trading platform or API that allows for automated trading.</li>

<li>Monitoring: After deployment, it's important to monitor the algorithm's performance in real-time. This may involve setting up alerts for specific events or conditions and regularly reviewing performance reports to ensure that the algorithm is performing as expected.</li>

<li>Overall, building a trading algorithm involves a combination of technical skills, market knowledge, and disciplined strategy formulation. By carefully designing and testing an algorithm, traders can potentially gain an edge in the highly competitive world of financial markets.</li>

## What is this repository?

In this thread, I will explore how to create an algorithmic trading strategy. The idea is to create a strategy using indicators and make a profitable bot in the end.
Thus we need to:
1) Download data for different tickers
2) Create the indicators
3) Create a way to define a strategy
4) Be able to backtest with said strategy
5) Repeat 2-4 until we find a profitable strategy
6) Explore how to create a bot out of the previous steps

PS. This is a long process, with several other things taking up my time. It's also a subject I don't know much about, but it is at the core of what my goals are. There will be a lot of back and forth and maybe several long breaks. Contributions/Comments/Help is always appreciated.

Wish me luck ðŸ¤ž
